ledi_documentation
==================

ReStructuredText documentation for LEDI. These .rst documents are mirrored
on http://techversat.com/projects/ledi/. The rst framework allows flexible
documentation transformation. 

The content is composed in readable text, and the same text is parsed and 
processed by python docutils framework, which can then generate various
documentation formats including but not limited to html, pdf.

An excellent utility program called `rst2wp` is also provided. This python tool
is a heavily modified version of https://github.com/glasserc/rst2wp.
