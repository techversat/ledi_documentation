0x06 LEDI PC Interface Dev
==========================

LEDI can be connected to PC to act as a personal ticker. It communicates over
serial port at 38400 baud rate. To make this work, you will need FTDI adaptors
like these:

* `Sparkfun's FTDI Basic Breakout <https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9716>`_
* `Seeedstudio's UartSBee V4 <http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/uartsbee-v31-p-688.html?cPath=104_109>`_


Setting Up LEDI with PC
=======================

We assume you have an access to a Linux box. We used Ubuntu 12.10 for our tests.
